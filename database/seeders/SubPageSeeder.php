The detectors are created in the form of plug-in scripts, which allows them to be adapted to the conditions of a particular object. Data on suspicious incidents and confirmation of uncleanness of employees, along with a dozen unique reports, are provided to analysts and can be verified by manual event search, which in total guarantees full control over the situation.
            
            The system saves not the receipt text but the sales events, cancellations, refunds, annulment etc in the database. Also there is capability of data search in any combination of facts, receipt number, the cashier&#39;s name, period of time, purchase sum etc.',

The second uses frames of objects recognized by the first network to create their unique features. Tracking is the main part of the object detector.
